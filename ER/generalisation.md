## **Generalization**
* **Generalization** is the result of computing the **union** of two or more entity sets to produce a higher-level entity set. It represents the containment relationship that exists between the higher-level entity set and one or more lower-level entity sets.
 
* It is the reverse of specialization process. Several classes with common features are generalised into a superclass; original classes becomes it subclasses. 
* Example: We can view {CAR, TRUCK} as a **specialization** of VEHICLE. Alternatively, we can view VEHICLE as a **generalization**  of CAR and TRUCK.
