## **Strong and Weak Entities**

* Entity type that doesnâ€™t have a key attribute on it's own is called **weak entity** and regular entity type that have key value are called **strong entity**.
* Entity belonging to weak entity type is identified by being related to specific entities from another entity type in combination with one of their attribute value.
* Weak entities have always a **total participation constraint** because they cannot be identified without an owner entity.
* The weak entities are represented by a **double lined rectangle (entity)** connected via a **double lined arrow (total participation constraint)** to a **double lined diamond (relationship)**.
