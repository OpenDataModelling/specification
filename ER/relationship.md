##  **Relationship type**
* When attributes of an entity refer to another entity type, there exists a **relationship** between them.
* In ER diagrams these references must be represented as relationships and not attributes.
* The relationships are denoted by **diamond symbol** and are usually **verbs**.
 
### Degree of a relationship
* It is the number of entity types that participate in a relationship.
* If there are two entity types involved: it is a **binary relationship** type.

* It is a relationship where the same entity participates more than once in different roles.
